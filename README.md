#Narrator

This is a small application built for the production of Columbia University's "Late Night" play: _How to Business_, directed by Alexandra Warrick and Nathaniel Jameson. It takes spoken input from a browser's input, converts it to text, and outputs it verbally using Google's Web Speech and Speech Synthesis APIs. 

##TODO

* Implement recognition of contenteditable changes made to the certain element
* Fix bug where no space is inserted upon recognition's restart
